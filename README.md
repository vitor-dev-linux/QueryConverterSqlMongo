# SQL to MongoDB Query Converter

**A powerful PHP tool that converts SQL queries to MongoDB syntax**

This repository contains an advanced PHP class that translates SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) into MongoDB query syntax, supporting:

âœ¨ **Full CRUD operations conversion**  
âœ… SELECT â†’ find()/aggregate()  
âœ… INSERT â†’ insertOne()/insertMany()  
âœ… UPDATE â†’ updateMany() with $set  
âœ… DELETE â†’ deleteMany()

**Key Features:**
- Supports complex WHERE conditions with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Handles JOIN operations (converted to $lookup aggregation)
- Converts SQL functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG) to MongoDB aggregation operators
- Processes GROUP BY with HAVING clauses
- Maintains ORDER BY, LIMIT and OFFSET functionality
- Type conversion for values (strings, numbers, booleans, null)
- Comprehensive error handling

**Use Cases:**
- Migrating from SQL to MongoDB databases
- Learning MongoDB syntax by comparing with familiar SQL
- Building polyglot persistence applications
- Educational purposes for database courses

**Example Conversion:**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01' 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
```

Converts to:
```javascript
db.employees.aggregate([
  { $match: { hire_date: { $gt: "2020-01-01" } } },
  { $group: {
      _id: "$department",
      avg_salary: { $avg: "$salary" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
  }},
  { $match: { count: { $gt: 5 } } },
  { $sort: { avg_salary: -1 } }
])
```

**Getting Started:**
1. Include the converter class in your project
2. Call `MongoSQLConverter::convert(your_sql_query)`
3. Get perfect MongoDB syntax

**Contributions Welcome!**  
This project is open for improvements and additional SQL feature support.
